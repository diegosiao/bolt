# bolt
The purpose of this framework is to provide an interface engine based on a language similar to HTML and using OpenGL and C++ with the objective to support cross platform development of native applications.

The basic approach is having a shared engine like a "browser" but with different concepts. For example:
* Create a concept of "app" to web navigation instead of "sites"
* Structure, Behavior and Content separation for those "apps"
* Updatable binaries with manageable local permissions instead of "scripts"
